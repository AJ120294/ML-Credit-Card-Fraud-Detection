# ML-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project applies machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset. It explores EDA, data preprocessing, class imbalance handling (SMOTE), and model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) with threshold tuning to optimize fraud detection.
